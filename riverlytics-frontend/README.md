## Installation

If you are reading this on github, you can fork this template to create a new repository from this template to your account. Then you can do a `git clone` to clone it to your local system.

Alternatively, you can clone the project directly from this repo to your local system.

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3templates/Riverlytics-astro.git myProjectName
# or
git clone https://github.com/web3templates/Riverlytics-astro.git .

The `.` will clone it to the current directory so make sure you are inside your project folder first.

After that make sure you remove the remote origin and set your own.

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── pages/
│       └── ...
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is already configured in this repo, so you can start using it without any installation.
